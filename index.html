                <p>
                    I am a Systems Engineering student with a strong interest in software development and technological problem-solving. 
                    During my academic training at Universidad del Norte, I have gained solid knowledge in programming, data analysis, 
                    and system design, and have worked on various academic projects that have allowed me to apply and strengthen these skills.

                    <br><br>

                    My passion for technology has led me to participate in hackathons, university projects and online courses where I have 
                    developed practical skills in Java, Python and Javascript tecnologies. I am a proactive individual with the ability 
                    to quickly learn and adapt to new environments and technologies.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    I am seeking an opportunity to start my professional career in full-stack web developer, where I can apply my knowledge, 
                    learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to the success of the team. My goal is to grow as a professional in 
                    a challenging and dynamic environment, and to add value with my enthusiasm and teamwork skills.
